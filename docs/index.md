# Reversion

Reversion is a Library that extends Cloudburst Protocol to provide protocol level support for MultiVersion in Geyser and will eventually
allow any supported version to connect to any supported Geyser.

If you've heard of [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) then this is the equivalent but for the Bedrock.
It allows any of the supported client versions listed below to connect to any of the supported server versions.
